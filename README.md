# SoftSynth
My CCI Freshman Design Project, created under HISE. A plug-in that serves to help musicians overcome their musician's block, and introduce beginners to the world of digital music production.

As a plug-in:
  Follow your digital audio workstation's instructions on how to integrate a plug-in.
  
As a stand-alone app:
  Simply run the SoftSynth.exe.
  
If you would like to make your own changes to the program, clone the repo, and load the project from HISE.
